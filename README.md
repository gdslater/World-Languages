# World-Languages
A Dashboard of World Languages. You can type languages to learn details such as which countries they are spoken in, how many native speakers, 2nd language speakers, etc. Building this Dashboard will give me more exposure to web scraping with Beautiful Soup and more experience with pandas and plotly.
